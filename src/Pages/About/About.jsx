            InstaBoard was created with simplicity and community in mind. We aim to provide a clean and intuitive user interface
            powered by <strong>React</strong>, while taking advantage of modern libraries like <strong>React Router</strong> and <strong>CSS Modules</strong> for seamless navigation and responsive design.

          <p>
            This project is part of a hands-on learning journey, helping us understand how to manage routing,
            share data between pages using <strong>useLocation</strong>, and control page behavior using <strong>useEffect</strong>.
            We also use <strong>localStorage</strong> to keep track of users' liked posts and preferences.
